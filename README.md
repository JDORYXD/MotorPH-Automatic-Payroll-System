## 💻 Program Details

The **MotorPH Automatic Payroll System** is a Java console-based application that automates payroll processing. The system reads employee information and attendance records from CSV files and calculates employee salaries based on their recorded working hours.

The program determines the total hours worked by each employee within a selected payroll cutoff period (1–15 or 16–31 of the month). Using the employee’s hourly rate, it calculates the gross salary and automatically applies government deductions such as **SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and withholding tax** to produce the final net salary.

The system allows users to log in either as an **employee** to view payroll details or as **payroll personnel** to process and review payroll data.
